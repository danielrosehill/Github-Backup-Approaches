# Github Backup Approaches

What's stopping you from making more liberal use of the amazing features that Github has to offer for open-sourcing projects, discovering and contributing to other codebases, etc? 

For me the answer is simple but it might surprise some:

**Backups!**

I have a strong aversion to creating data on the cloud that is not thoroughly backed-up and every time I create a lot of data I think to myself: *"how can I make sure that I retain access to this in all eventualities, including getting locked out of this particular cloud?"*

As a minimum viable standard for backups, I like to follow the tried-and-trusted  `3-2-1` rule even if it has since been deprecated in enterprise use in favor of more elaborate systems like `3-2-1-1-0` (and others). But hey: individual developers aren't enterprises and 3-2-1 is good enough for me. 

The purpose of this repository is to open-source my thinking and progress in finding robust solutions to Github *account* backup, particularly for those who have scaled to hundreds or thousands of repositories. 

Over time I aim to include, at least:

- An overview of backup solutions currently on the market
- A few scripts for DIY Github backups (and links to existing projects, or those which have been attempted)
- Thoughts on how to backup specific data "pools" in a Github account beyond repositories (for example, the list of repositories that users "*star*")
- Ideas and suggestions

## Formatting

I enjoy writing in markdown and so many of my repos just consist of `.md` files. This one will probably continue in a similar format although I will add a few scripts as I create them.

## Repository Map

### Commercial Github Backup Solutions

These are listed in a file by that name (more or less) in the main repo.

### Github Github Backup Projects

Backup scripts and utilities for Github authored by third parties and shared on Github (for the most part). These are typically community driven non-commercial open-source projects.
